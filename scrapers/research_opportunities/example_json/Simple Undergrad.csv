 Project Description:
 This project aims to develop a general reasoning agent for bimanual robotic manipulation tasks, especially those that are long-horizon and requires exploration.  Imagine giving the robot a box of assembly toys and it needs to play with them with curiosities and figure out the correct strategy to build them.  Or imagine giving the robot a basket of laundry and it needs to figure out which ones to fold and store and which ones to hang on rack.
 Prerequisite Knowledge:
 Must have: taken linear algebra, able to code in python fluently, not afraid of hands-on work.  Nice to have: experience with LLM, VLM, AI agent, understandings of probability, statistics, machine learning, deep learning, robotics, 3D design, software or infra development experience. Most importantly, willingness to learn and at least 8 hours a week to spend on research.
