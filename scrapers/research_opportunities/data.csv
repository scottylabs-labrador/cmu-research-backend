2. To enable LLMs to generate, annotate, and modify Move smart contract code according to user instructions through Few Shot Prompt Engineering or fine-tuning LLMs.
3. To write sample test code to assess the performance of different methods.

Our future goal is to enable LLMs to understand Sui Move and guide developers on Sui Move development by integrate it into my previous work, GPTutor.

Yet, operating transit is more complex than the light-duty passenger vehicles for which AV technologies are commonly designed. Buses are significantly larger and operate in highly variable environments with many stops and starts near vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians and cyclists. Furthermore, transit operations require supporting passengers and maintaining safety inside the vehicle. Due to both technical and operational challenges, transit vehicles including buses and vans will continue to require skilled human drivers, even as automated vehicle capabilities are incorporated. 

To help maintain transit’s already high level of safety for passengers, it is essential to understand how automation stands to affect the roles and day-to-day tasks of trained drivers. For example, driver assistance automation such as pedestrian warnings and lane-centering has the potential to improve the safety and workload of drivers. At the same time, automation can create new kinds of safety issues caused by the interactions in human-autonomy teams and can intensify work as people primarily take over from automation in the most challenging situations. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider how to go about incorporating automation technologies into fleets and to develop new interfaces for transit drivers to work effectively in maintaining safety on the road, and alongside vulnerable road users. 

In this research, we draw on our ongoing partnerships with two major transit unions to develop technologies and interfaces that would help bus drivers in their work, and improve operations. This work will also include passenger-facing design engagement through partnerships with local rider advocacy organizations focused on understanding how these technologies could enhance overall rider experience, with the aim of supporting safety and accessibility. Over the course of the semester, we will conduct workshops and other participatory design activities to imagine and develop co-designed prototypes of new automation technologies and human-machine interfaces to support a more just and accessible future of transit for drivers and passengers.

Many learners reside in low-infrastructure contexts, in which they face numerous obstacles, including lack of educational resources, expensive schooling fees, lack of internet access, etc that prevent them from receiving basic educational experiences. Many African countries, including Uganda, are also heavily influenced by their colonial history, which is reflected in the languages used as a medium of instruction for educational systems, English being a predominant language. However, this educational model presents challenges for students in low-infrastructure and rural areas, where English proficiency tends to be limited.
We are currently in the process of conducting a randomized controlled trial where students are split into two language conditions: English and Leblango, which is a main local language used in Ugandan communities. In this RCT, we are investigating three main questions : 1) Perspectives on Language in STEM: views of students and facilitators on language use in STEM education 2) Language Impact on Learning: influence of instructional language on the student learning experience, STEM motivation, and career prospects 3)Technology's Role in Language Learning: impact of technology on learning effectiveness in English versus local languages.

We are looking for students who are passionate about conducting behavioral research in education and qualitative data analysis, with a strong focus on thematic analyses and in-depth exploration of qualitative data, including interview transcripts, discussion-based conversations, and other data sources.

This independent study will explore various GitHub public repositories and their policies regarding AI-powered coding assistants by analysing GitHub trace data. Also, we will perform comparative analysis on how different levels of AI adoption influence developers’ activities within repositories.

Theory of Mind (ToM) is a basic social and cognitive human capability of attributing mental states such as beliefs, emotions, knowledge, and plans to oneself and others based on explicit and latent behavioral and verbal cues. AI systems equipped with ToM-like capabilities present great promises in enhancing the efficiency, naturalness, and human experiences in human-AI communication, collaboration, and interactions. For example, in human-AI teams, AI systems with ToM-like capabilities can infer human partners’ intentions, plans, and knowledge state to provide timely and necessary information for task completion, as well as accounting for irrational human behaviors that deviate from the original plan. As such AI systems display ToM-like capabilities, humans are also leveraging our own ToM capability to make inferences about the AI’s internal states. This forms the emerging phenomenon of Mutual Theory of Mind (MToM), where both the human and the AI possess ToM-like capabilities to continuously infer and attribute mental states to each other during an interaction. While a successful MToM depicts a future of human-AI interaction that is adaptive, continuous, constructive, and natural, the specific challenges and opportunities of designing and building towards MToM in human-AI interaction have not been explored. This project aims at leveraging design and qualitative research methods to envision the future of MToM in human-AI interaction with multiple stakeholders such as users and industry AI practitioners. This project seeks to identify the opportunities and challenges of MToM from different stakeholders’ unique perspectives and experiences, including the potential responsible AI consequences of MToM in human-AI interaction.

Rather than submitting written proofs for weekly grades, students will devote a fixed number of hours (e.g., six) each week—either face-to-face with TAs or online—to practicing core concepts at their own pace. We will use VTutor to enable real-time monitoring through AI-supported screen sharing, collaborative tutor oversight, and an engaging on-screen avatar. This redesign addresses three urgent issues in CMU courses: (1) the surge in large language model (LLM) use for automatically generating homework solutions, which erodes genuine learning and academic integrity; (2) heightened student anxiety over difficult, high-workload coursework; and (3) the struggle of conventional course structures to challenge a student body with widely varying levels of prior experience.

By shifting the emphasis from correctness-based grading to ongoing, individualized practice, we anticipate deeper conceptual mastery, heightened intrinsic motivation, and decreased stress across the semester. Rather than grading homework correctness, which can be easily achieved by the use of AI, this structure evaluates students based on consistent, meaningful engagement aligned with their proficiencies. After piloting and assessing this approach in the summer and fall term, we aim to adapt and expand it as a foundational blueprint for personalized, adaptive learning in other courses.","We are looking for independent study / paid position over summer and to fall 2025

In particular, their limited field of view, resolution, and input make interactions with traditional interfaces cumbersome. For instance, consider browsing the New York Times with a small 70-degree view window. Because the display limits the amount the user can see at once, they either have to zoom out of the window, which makes the text more difficult to read, or slowly scan through parts of the window bit by bit. Both cases can quickly result in eye and neck strain. 

In this project, we investigate the feasibility of automatically adapting interfaces for AR leveraging generative models. To accommodate the smaller field of view, we propose decomposing an interface into its constituent elements and only showing to the user a relevant subset. To determine how exactly we should decompose an interface into its constituent elements and what to show in the final AR interface, we propose leveraging existing knowledge on user flows (i.e., a user's journey to complete specific tasks within an application or service).

That said, how can we leverage the emotional states of users to drive adaptive interactions? By understanding the role of emotions in shaping user experience, we can create virtual environments that are more engaging, intuitive, and responsive to individual needs.

In this work, the student will design and implement different interaction styles that either match or counteract users’ emotional state and conduct a user study where different users will experience these different interactions.

As an example, when experiencing anger, instead of a simple touch button activated with the hand (neutral), an example of such an interaction style could be:
(Match anger) - the button activates only if pressed with some power strength or via repeated interactions mimicking, for instance, a punching bag;
(Counteract anger) - the button activates only if gently pressed or unlocks only after the user has taken a couple breaths in and out;

A user study will compare the effectiveness of these interaction styles in improving task performance and user satisfaction. Participants will be exposed to both matching and counteracting interactions in different scenarios. The study will gather data on task completion times, as well as subjective feedback regarding user experience and preference for each style.

In sum, the goal of this project is to provide insights into how emotionally adaptive interfaces should be designed to best support users in different tasks (i.e., a set of design guidelines).

This project explores how body duplication - the ability to record and replay one's own body movements - can be leveraged to support productivity and self-guidance in VR environments. Imagine leaving behind a ghost of yourself performing a task such as assembling an object, sorting items, or navigating a complex space, and later reviewing or learning from it. These duplications of the self could help users monitor progress, repeat physical workflows, or plan actions more effectively across time.

In this work, the student will design and implement a VR prototype that enables:

Recording of body poses and movements over time (e.g., using headset and hand tracking, or full MOCAP system);
Replay of body duplicates in VR, aligned in time and space;
Interaction with the duplicate through controls like play, pause, and rewind, enabling the user to follow or learn from their past actions;

The student will conduct a user study to investigate how body duplication affects user performance, recall, task planning, and subjective perception of presence and control, in different use cases such as repetitive workflows, training routines, etc.
